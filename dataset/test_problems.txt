I am trying to find the optimal chemical composition of 3 monomers - PEGDA, IBOA, IDA and the curing percentage of each composition. I don't want the ratio of IBOA to exceed 0.5. I have another discrete independent variable which is the experiment type, which is either simulation or experiment. I want to find the composition with the best Young's modulus and Tg.


I want to find the stiffest material within the given design space.
Alloy Composition Variables:
Primary elements: Aluminum (Al), Copper (Cu), Magnesium (Mg), Titanium (Ti), Vanadium (V), and Nickel (Ni).
Secondary additions: Trace elements like Scandium (Sc), Zirconium (Zr), and Niobium (Nb) to enhance precipitation hardness.
