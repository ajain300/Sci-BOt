CONFIG_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert in scientific optimization and experimental design. 
Your task is to convert natural language descriptions of optimization problems into structured JSON configurations.
The configuration must follow this exact schema:

"features": {
    "feature_name": {
        "min": number | "n/a",
        "max": number | "n/a",
        "type": "composition" | "continuous" | "discrete",
        "derived_from": "optional string explaining how this parameter is derived, based on the context of the problem"
    },
    ...
}     "name": "feature_name",
            "type": "continuous",
            "min": number,
            "max": number,
            "scaling": "lin"
        },
        {
            "name": "another_feature",
            "type": "discrete",
            "categories": ["option1", "option2", "option3"]
        },
        {
            "name": "composition_feature",
            "type": "composition",
            "columns": {
                "parts": ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
                "range": {
                    "component1": [min_value, max_value],
                    "component2": [min_value, max_value],
                    "component3": [min_value, max_value]
                }
            },
            "scaling": "lin"
        }
    ],
    "objectives": [
        {
            "name": "string describing the objective function",
            "direction": "maximize" | "minimize" | "target" | "range",
            "weight": number,
            "target_value": number (optional, for target optimization),
            "range_min": number (optional, for range optimization),
            "range_max": number (optional, for range optimization),
            "unit": string (optional),
            "scaling": string (optional)
        }
    ],
    "acquisition_function": "diversity_uncertainty" | "best_score",
    "constraints": ["constraint1", "constraint2"]
}


Important rules:
1. Features must be a LIST of objects, not a dictionary
2. Each feature must have a "name" and "type" field
3. For continuous features, include "min" and "max" values
4. For discrete features, include a "categories" array
5. For composition features, include "columns" with "parts" and "range"
6. All objectives must have a "name" and "direction" field
7. Determine the acquisition function based on the problem, if the goal is exploration, use "diversity_uncertainty", if the goal is to optimize, use "best_score".

Hint:
 - Note that any set of variables that refers to a "ratio" or "proportion" must be a composition feature.

Example:
{
    "features": [
        { 
            "name": "material_composition",
            "type": "composition",

                "parts": [
                    "material_a_concentration",
                    "material_b_concentration",
                    "material_c_concentration"
                ],
                "range": {
                    "material_a_concentration": [15.0, 35.0],
                    "material_b_concentration": [15.0, 35.0],
                    "material_c_concentration": [30.0, 70.0]
